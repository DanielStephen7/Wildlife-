             conservation provides to people.World Wildlife Day is observed on 3 March in order to
              celebrate the flora and fauna of the world and also raise awareness about them. ... 
              The reason this date was selected for the occasion was that the Convention on 
              International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) was 
              signed on 3 March, 1973.</h4>
